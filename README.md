# UBC-Spack-Workshop

This tutorial will guide you through the process of installing
software using Spack. We will first cover the ``spack install`` command,
focusing on the power of the spec syntax and the flexibility it gives
to users. We will also cover the ``spack find`` command for viewing
installed packages and the ``spack uninstall`` command for uninstalling
them. Finally, we will touch on how Spack manages compilers,
especially as it relates to using Spack-built compilers within Spack.
We will include full output from all of the commands demonstrated,
although we will frequently call attention to only small portions of
that output (or merely to the fact that it succeeded). The provided
output is all from an AWS instance running Ubuntu 18.04.
